## MULT7: 1->7 buffered multiple (3HP)

An updated version of my buffered mult module - 1HP wider than its predecessor but it also has 2 extra channels (7 instead of 5)

### Build notes

This is a straightforward build - all that's needed are a handful of passives and a couple of op-amps.

Anything goes, op-amp wise, providing it is pin-compatible with the TL0x4 series. I generally use TL084s, but the TL074 works fine too.
